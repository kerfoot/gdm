summary: The Challenger Glider Mission is a re-creation of the first global scientific
  ocean survey conducted by the HMS Challenger from 1872-1876. The goals of the mission
  are to establish a collaborative international network of autonomous underwater
  glider ports, to assess global ocean model predictive skill while contributing real-time
  profile data for assimilation in ocean forecast models by operational centers worldwide,
  and to crowd source student-based ocean research and discovery. Glider is providingtemperature,
  conductivity, salinity, density and current profile observations. The current profiles
  are logged via external pd0 files and are not available in this real-time dataset.
  RU29 is flying in the vicinity of the Anegada Passage and throughout the surrounding
  island regions to monitor heat transport between the Caribbean Sea and the Tropical
  North Atlantic. This region includes the US Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands,
  and Anguilla, areas commonly impacted by tropical cyclones. This real-time data
  set contains CTD, chlorophyll, CDOM, beta700nm and ADCP measurements.
